## Problem
- looked for the list of available LSPs/DAPs for mason
- tried looking in `mason.nvim` helptags and searched for "server" but no dice

## Solution
- finally found it in README (github page)
- [mason registry](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list)

useful in looking for other LSP/DAP for mason

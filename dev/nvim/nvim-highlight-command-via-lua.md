## Problem
trying to change the highlight (background) of the CursorLine to blank to see the ghost text/tabs clearly

## Solution
- learned via google search `nvim highlight command in lua`
- from this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73370407) answer
- might be better to look in "api" in via help / `<F1>`

useful in changing the highlight, also for looking in nvim api in `<F1>`

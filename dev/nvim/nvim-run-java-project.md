## Problem
udemy lesson uses IntelliJ for running Spring Boot application, however nvim does not have it, at least from my knowledge

## Solution
- `:JavaRunnerRunMain`
- this opens another window in neovim and runs the Spring Boot application
- based on nvim-java documentation inside nvim

useful in running the Java project inside neovim

- from this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hgszl7/css_snippet_for_some_pretty_checkboxes_from_border/
	- cool stuff since it is only CSS for `li[data-task="?"]`
- maybe it is possible to create my own especially for `- [\?\?]` for question and `- [\?\!]` for answered question
	- without `\`; added backslash to not include when grep/searching
- or maybe just use question and important?


useful in creating different styles of checkboxes

## Problem
```
@Annotation(arg1="one", arg2="two")
```
i don't know what the arguments inside an annotation is called

## Solution
- googled `what do you call parameter inside annotation java`
- it is called elements based on Java docs
- based on [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28043994)

useful in calling the correct name of the parameters/arguments inside the Java annotations

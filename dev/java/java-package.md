- in Java, a `package` is a directory that contains classes
- just a directory, no special `__init__.py` from python
- files/classes inside must have `package com.something.something;` in order to be considered as part of package
- in nvim-java, no way to currently create manually a package, but since it is just a directory, we can just create it :)

useful in understanding that a java `package` is just a directory

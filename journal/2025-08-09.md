## What's my plan for today?
- [x] continue bi-directional mapping and more and more
- [x] DTO approach

## Devlog
- due to [java-spring-boot-response-recursive-rendering](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-response-recursive-rendering.md), decided to create DTO
	- [java-spring-boot-data-transfer-object](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-data-transfer-object.md)

- delete instructor detail with `CascadeType.ALL`
	- ![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809152811.png)
	```log

	```
	
- delete instructor detail, no cascade
	- [java-spring-boot-bidirectional-mapping-no-cascade-delete](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-bidirectional-mapping-no-cascade-delete.md)


## What will I do tomorrow?
- continue one-to-many mapping
- finish spring boot training arc?

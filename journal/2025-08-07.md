## What's my plan for today?
- [x] recap day-14
- [x] continue to udemy section 9 chapter 289

## Devlog
- noticed that with `(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)` ([java-jpa-cascade-types](../dev/java/jpa/java-jpa-cascade-types.md)), we are able to save both `Instrucotr` and `InstructorDetail` even if there is no `InstructorDetailRepository`
- finished simple CRUD
	- changes are mostly on initialization and POST request
- `@OneToOne(mappedBy="")` ([java-jpa-mappedby-element](../dev/java/jpa/java-jpa-onetoone-annotation.md))
	
- warning when accessing GET endpoint after adding bidirectional mapping
	- [java-spring-boot-response-recursive-rendering](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-response-recursive-rendering.md)

## What will I do tomorrow?
- continue bi-directional mapping and more and more

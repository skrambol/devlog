## What's my plan for today?
- [x] jpa/hibernate advanced mappings (relational db)

## Devlog
- `@OneToOne`
	- [java-spring-boot-onetoone-annotation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-onetoone-annotation.md)

- cascade types for 
	- [java-spring-boot-cascade-types](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-cascade-types.md)

- entity lifecycle
	- [java-spring-boot-entity-lifecycle](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-entity-lifecycle.md)
	
- actually used notes for using `JpaRepository` and Spring Data REST
	- [java-spring-boot-data-rest](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-data-rest.md)
	- [java-spring-repository-annotation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-repository-annotation.md)
	- [java-spring-service-annotation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-service-annotation.md)
	- [java-spring-boot-rest-application-steps](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-rest-application-steps.md)
	- [java-spring-boot-jdbc-application-properties](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-jdbc-application-properties.md)

- how to handle db relationships in Spring Data Rest
	- [java-spring-boot-data-rest-db-relationships](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-data-rest-db-relationships.md)

- `@RequestBody` is null
	- [java-spring-boot-requestbody-is-null](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-requestbody-is-null.md)

- `@RequestBody MyClass` some fields are null
	- [java-spring-boot-requestbody-null-fields](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-requestbody-object-instantiation.md)
	
- Spring Boot seems to automatically use blank constructor and use setters when instantiating a new object from that class
	- whenever an `@Entity` object will be created, it will call its blank constructor
	- created constructor `Instructor(String firstName, String lastName)` but this was never called
	- added `prinln` to setters and it was being called
	- actually not fully correct since this is mostly observed on `@RequestBody`. other `@Bean` do not have blank constructors
	- [??] maybe this is the behavior if there is a blank constructor? if there is only a non-blank constructor maybe it will be added via dependency injection?
	
- my `setFirstName` implementation also updates email (`{firstInitial}.{lastName.trim().toLowerCase()}@email.com`)
	- [java-spring-boot-requestbody-setters](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-requestbody-setters.md)

- `@RequestBody` for `@Entity` with `@OneToOne` mapping
	- [java-spring-boot-requestbody-for-entity-with-onetoone](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-requestbody-for-entity-with-onetoone.md)

- `@JsonIgnore`
	- [java-spring-boot-jsonignore-annotation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-jsonignore-annotation.md)

## What will I do tomorrow?
- recap day-14
- continue to udemy section 9 chapter 289

## What's my plan for today?
- [x] continue one-to-many mapping
- [-] finish spring boot training arc?

## Devlog
- one instructor to many courses
	- bidirectional
	- delete should not cascade
- `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` 
	- create foreign key at `@ManyToOne`
		- `@JoinColumn`
	- create connection at `@OneToMany`
		- `mappedBy` element
	- create convenience method to `@OneToMany`
		- add to objects `mappedBy`
		- set foreign key to `@OneToMany`

## What did I do today?
- flexoki-light for Style obsidian plugin
- css snippet for (relative) line numbers
- more housekeeping on obsidian

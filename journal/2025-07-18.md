## What's my plan for today?
- [x] install asdf
	- seems to be not needed since nvim-java has installed openjdk 17
- [x] install nvim-java
	- applied workaround
- [x] start java spring boot?

## What did I do today?
- obsidian setup
	- vimrc

## What did I learn today?
- [apt-search-only-installed](../dev/shell/apt-search-only-installed.md)
- nvim-java workaroud https://github.com/nvim-java/nvim-java/issues/384
	- nvim-java not supported currently on mason.nvim 2.0
	- workaround is to set version to 1.0.0 to avoid conflict
- [java-spring-boot-run-on-command-line](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-run-on-command-line.md) (more on devlog)
- [bash-debug-script](../dev/shell/bash-debug-script.md) (more on devlog)

## Devlog
- Spring Boot
	- quick start in Spring and other related technologies/frameworks (Spring MVC, Spring Rest)
- Spring Initializr
	- https://start.spring.io
- was not able to run spring boot immediately due to no IDE :(
	- managed to search for the command
		- [java-spring-boot-run-on-command-line](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-run-on-command-line.md)
		- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
	- however, command was not outputting anything so decided to debug. thankfully command is bash script
		- [bash-debug-script](../dev/shell/bash-debug-script.md)
		- `bash -x <scripity>`
	- decided to read script and there is option for verbosity `MVNW_VERBOSE` that when set to true it will `set -x` within the script which outputs that the zip file is being downloaded
		- `MVNW_VERBOSE=true ./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- after maven install, was able to run!
	- ![Pasted image 20250718114018](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250718114018.png)

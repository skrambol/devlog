### Devlog
- Spring Security w/ more users and roles
	- [java-spring-boot-security-user-and-roles-creation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-security-user-and-roles-creation.md)
- Spring Security uses `Basic Auth` by default for Authorization header
	 - [java-spring-boot-security-default-authorization-header](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-security-default-authorization-header.md)
- Bruno set authentication header
	- per request, folder, or collection
	- can inherit from parent (request -> folder -> collection)
	- to set
		- click on request, folder, or collection
		- click on Auth tab, set authentication details from there
- restricting access based on role
	- [java-spring-boot-security-restrict-access-based-on-roles](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-security-restrict-access-based-on-roles.md)
- error when following udemy

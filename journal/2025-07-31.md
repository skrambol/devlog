## What's my plan for today?
- [x] continue Spring Data REST (automagic REST endpoints)

## What did I do today?

### Devlog
- Spring Data REST
	- [java-spring-boot-data-rest](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-data-rest.md)
	- `GET /entitys?sort=field1,field2,desc`
		- sorts by field1, field2 in descending order
		- [??] what if you have a field with asc or desc as its name?
- springdoc
	- [java-spring-springdoc](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-springdoc.md)
	- `springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/docs`
		- when visiting `/docs` still redirects to `swagger-ui/index.html`
		- check springdoc docs for more info
		
- Spring Boot Security
	- [java-spring-boot-starter-security](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-boot-starter-security.md)

## What did I learn today?
- 

## What will I do tomorrow?

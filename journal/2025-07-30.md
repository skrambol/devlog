## What's my plan for today?
- [x] continue udemy section 4 chapter 135

## What did I do today?

### Devlog
- `JpaRepository<Entity, PrimaryKey>`
	- [java-spring-jparepository](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-jparepository.md)

## What did I learn today?
- BUSINESS LOGIC BEYBEH!
	- [java-spring-service-annotation](../dev/java/spring/java-spring-service-annotation.md)
	- since the Spring Boot Service layer is where we put `@Transactional`, it seems that multiple db updates possibly from multiple tables happen in that function
	- for example, when selling, you will most likely update an inventory db table as well your daily sales table

## What will I do tomorrow?
- continue Spring Data REST (automagic REST endpoints)
